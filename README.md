Data analysis project on Student Performance Analysis using Python, Pandas, and PDFPlumber !

From extracting table data from a PDF to analysing academic performance — I explored how subject-wise marks contribute to overall scores and ranking.

🔍Key insights:

- Successfully extracted structured table data from a PDF using pdfplumber
- Identified Top Ranking Students based on total marks
- Highlighted Low Ranking Students for performance improvement
- Cleaned and transformed the extracted PDF data into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis . 

🛠Tools used: Python, Pandas, PDFPlumber, Jupyter Notebook
